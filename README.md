NVDB api V2 with FME
===============
Sample FME workspaces to fetch various data from NVDB api. 

Please note that the location of the xfsmap definition file (*xfmapDefintion_nvdbapi2fme_V2.xml*) in the XMLFeatureReader transformer must be adjusted to match your local file system. In most cases, it should work straight out of the box - if not, just pop open the "point at file" dialog, click on the file and hit OK.

# nvdbapi_V2_Bomstasjoner.fmw 

Will download all toll stations (Bomstasjoner) from NVDB api. Optionally, you may also augment the data set with street names. If enablet, for each Bomstasjon-feature we attempt to fetch street names at the bomstasjon locations in the road network(NVDB object "Gate", property "Gatenavn" at the same route ID + road network position). See https://www.vegvesen.no/nvdb/apidokumentasjon/#/verdi/veglenke 

> **Note** Due to a bug in NVDB api, we cant search for objects at a **precise** point at the road network: We must search within a stretch of the road. So instead of the _linkID@position_ syntax we  use _linkID@fromPosition-toPosition_ 
 

Make sure the location of the xfsmap defintion file (*xfmapDefintion_nvdbapi2fme_V2.xml*) in the XMLFeatureReader transformer matches your local file system. 


# nvdbapi_V2_trafikkulykker.fmw 

Will download road accidents (trafikkulykke) from NVDB api for Troms√∏ kommune. Optionally, only download accidents with property  _Alvorligste skadegrad = drept_

Make sure the location of the xfsmap defintion file (*xfmapDefintion_nvdbapi2fme_V2.xml*) in the XMLFeatureReader transformer matches your local file system.
